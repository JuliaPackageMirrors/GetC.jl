This package is a minimal implementation of Jasper's Julia FFI. It will load
the ccall function/type signatures specificed by Jasper's FFI.

This has been tested on a 2010 Macbook running Linux (Fedora 17) and a custom
built PC desktop running Linux (Fedora 17). Have fun!

All of this was written by Jasper den Ouden (https://github.com/o-jasper). I
simply put it into a Julia package.  All credit goes to him.

Thanks to the Julia team (http://julialang.org) for making Julia, a programming
language that many have been longing for, whether they knew about it or not.
The "Octave-for-C-programmers," as one could think of it, is an incredibly fast
and powerful programming language that is a welcome breath of fresh air in the
technical and numerical programming communities.
