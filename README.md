This package is a minimal implementation of Jasper's Julia FFI. It will load
the ccall function/type signatures specificed by Jasper's FFI.

All of this was written by Jasper den Ouden (https://github.com/o-jasper). I
simply to put it into a Julia package.  All credit goes to him.

This has been tested on a 2010 Macbook running Linux (Fedora 17) and a custom
built PC desktop running Linux (Fedora 17). Have fun!
