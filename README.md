This package is intended to be a fully fledged Julia FFI.

The VAST majority of work was done by Jasper den Ouden (@o-jasper).  Without
his FFI, C header parser, original examples, and responses to my questions, I
would never have been able to put this into a Julia package.  All credit goes
to him.

It will load the ccall function/type signatures specificed by Jasper's FFI.

At the moment, this has only been tested on a 2010 Macbook running Linux
(Fedora 17) and a custom built PC desktop running Linux (Fedora 17). Have fun!
