This package is a minimal implementation of Jasper's Julia FFI. It will load
the ccall function/type signatures specificed by Jasper's FFI.

#Installation

```julia
Pkg.add("GetC")
```

#Credit

The original idea and version was developed by [Jasper den Ouden](https://github.com/o-jasper).  The current implementation is a trimmed version with some updates for changes to Expr in Julia 0.2.

Thanks to the [Julia team](http://julialang.org) for making Julia, a programming
language that many have been longing for, whether they knew about it or not.
The "Octave-for-C-programmers," as one could think of it, is an incredibly fast
and powerful programming language that is a welcome breath of fresh air in the
technical and numerical programming communities.

Have fun!
